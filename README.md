* (Jun 28 - Aug 17)

* **Note**: This timeline doesn't include big practice, it's optional.

* Target: Get familiar with JavaScript ES6 syntax, know the basic differences between asynchronous and synchronous, briefly introduction basic DOM manipulation

## Environment

* Development tools: [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp)

* **Note**: Supporters should help setup JS environment with Parcel before start.

* VSCode suggestions

  * [ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

  * [Prettier Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

  * Setting up ESLint - Airbnb JS styles on VSCode or here

## Part I

* Syntax (and includes Values, Variables, Types, Operators, Precedenceâ€¦)

* Array, Objects, Functions, Classes

## Part II

## DOM manipulation

* Introduction: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GAKFRE5J3H_lfjMWouv0B0JGkOB0kW4j/view) or [PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GAKFRE5J3H_lfjMWouv0B0JGkOB0kW4j/view)

* Querying/Modifying DOM: Link or PDF version

* Events: Link or PDF version

* **Note**: Just get DOM manipulation acquainted for figure out how it work/run, don't let trainees getting lost in deep

## Practice

* Note: Will better if supporters have brief introduce [Chrome DevTools for debugging JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/) or trainee can follow [this video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XScE08hy8) or follow [this video for debugging guideline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XScE08hy8)

### Exercise 1

* Target: Selecting Elements, Getting Values, and Setting Values

* [Link](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-dom-exercises.php) or [PDF-version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7bfCEAzq8dho5_XfXCjRMzUAgUxzV1O/view) (Part "About me")

### Exercise 2

* Target: Attributes, Classes and CSS Manipulation

* [Link](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-dom-exercises.php) or [PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JHsEkSchphyXK5D2jB0TGbisAeXBouZY/view) (Part 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10)

### Exercise 3

* Target: DOM manipulation with simple table, form

* PDF version ([Table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nLypEFH_KzfPhEQcY0W81kmAavQ-rw1k/view), [Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16nYUuoH_dAeNsba0hNQ9thyO3-hLaivU/view))

* We could combine Table & Form exercises into one big

## Big practice (Optional)

**Note**: This section is optional Targets:

* Understand & apply knowledge HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with ES6 syntax).

* Understanding & apply MVC (or any MV model or module concept)

* DOM manipulation, form validation.

* Understand how asynchronous code work & apply in practice (API call or any place we can as mock API in code).

* Get familiar with DevTools (e.g Google Chrome DevTools) for debugging issues (breakpoint, log, etc..).

* Deploy to the hosting (with help from supporter)

## Open questions

1. What's difference between **Truthy/Falsy** vs true/false in JavaScript? Why we should understand Truthy/Falsy in JS world?

2. How do you understand about **callback function**? List some cases we should use callback function.

3. How many types of **variable scopes**? List some cases we should use this variable scope instead of others. Why we should understand scope?

4. What is **Type Coercion**? What do you think Type Coercion will help?

5. What is short-circuit evaluation?

6. What are differences between **values & references**? Any potential issue/bug can occur you can see with reference? Please write down simple example.

7. What is **pure function**? List out benefit of pure function, and what are you understanding about side effect.

8. Pros and cons **mutable and immutable**. The array methods (as map, push, pop..) belongs to which one?

9. What problem do **Object destructuring**, and Spread operator resolve ?

10. What problem **asynchronous** resolve? What's difference between **Promise and Async/Await** (Compare on chaining asynchronous call, code execution order & handle error syntax)? Is there any relationship you think between promise & async await?

11. List some cases would you choose arrow function instead of regular function and vice versa?
